- set window min width+height
- page to view previously made playlists ... this would require the use of databases
	- provide stats (how many playlists user has made, how many new songs they have discovered)
- make branch
- description not always appearing.. is this spotipy issue or code
	-always works on local, sometimes does on heroku
	- check if description empty string??
- account for api failing in python code (AKA keep trying) (happens often with search)	
	- have x amount of retries, give up after that..
	- use rate limit (retry-after) https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/guides/rate-limits/
- have a dynamic and and static option (e.g. press button to search / dont auto recommend press buttton)
- does session expire after inactivity??
- can you reorganize view function so ajax functions exit early (don't need arg vars)??
	- seperate function into multiple functions
